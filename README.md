### The Dog to have highest possibility to see from each areas in NYC

One of the most significant thing I have noticed when I first came to NYC was how dog-friendly this city is. I loved how people live along with dogs in NYC, so I wanted to create a website about dogs in New York City.

This map shows which dog breeds are most likely to be seen from each areas in NYC, depending on the Zip code.

I used public NYC Dog Licensing Dataset for the data for dog breeds in each areas, and Stanford Dogs Dataset for dog images. This website with interactive map is based on simplemaps
